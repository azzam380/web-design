            >Smart and Sustainable Cities refer to urban areas that leverage
            technology, innovation, and sustainable practices to enhance <br />
            the quality of life for residents while reducing environmental
            impact and optimizing resource use. These cities focus on creating
            <br />
            a balance between urbanization, technological advancements, and
            sustainability to address the challenges posed by rapid <br />
            population growth, climate change, and resource scarcity.</b
